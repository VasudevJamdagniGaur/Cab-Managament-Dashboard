Also, implement an automatic carpooling feature in the SaaS dashboard. The system should automatically match users based on the proximity of their pickup and drop-off locations. When a user inputs their ride details, the system will calculate if their route is close enough to another user’s route. If a match is found, the system will automatically suggest a carpool option and display the matched carpool details on the dashboard for both users. The dashboard should show the carpool route, user names, and any relevant ride details, ensuring a seamless experience without requiring manual approval.
